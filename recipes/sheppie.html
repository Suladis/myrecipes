                <p>Shepherd's pie is a classic British dish that is known for
                    its
                    comforting and hearty nature.
                    It typically
                    consists of layers of ground or minced meat,
                    traditionally lamb (hence the name "shepherd's" pie), but variations with beef, pork, or poultry are
                    also
                    common. The meat is cooked with onions,
                    carrots, peas, and other vegetables, seasoned with herbs such as thyme and rosemary, and then topped
                    with a
                    generous layer of mashed potatoes.
                    The dish is baked in the oven until the potatoes turn golden brown, creating a delicious crust. </p>

                <p> Shepherd's pie is a versatile dish that can be adapted to individual preferences and
                    dietary
                    restrictions.
                    It is often enjoyed as a complete meal on its own, as it combines protein, vegetables, and starch in
                    one
                    dish.
                    The combination of savory meat, flavorful vegetables, and creamy mashed potatoes creates a
                    comforting
                    and
                    satisfying dish that is perfect for cooler weather or any time when you crave a hearty, home-cooked
                    meal.

                    <li> <a>3 large (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) potatoes , peeled and quartered </a></li>
                    <li> <a>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided </a></li>
                    <li> <a>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups) </a></li>
                    <li> <a> 1 to 2 cups mixed vegetables, such as diced carrots, corn, or peas </a></li>
                    <li> <a> 1 1/2 pounds ground round beef </a></li>
                    <li> <a>1/2 cup beef broth </a></li>
                    <li> <a> 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class=" column">
                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Boil the Potatoes
                        <br>
                        <span></span>
                        Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold
                        water.
                        Add
                        a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20
                        minutes).
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li> Preheat the oven to 400 F </li>

                    <li>Saute the vegetables </li>
                    <p>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium
                        heat.
                        Add
                        the
                        chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes. </p>
                    <p>If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be
                        cooked
                        with
                        the
                        onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do. </p>
                    <p>If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after
                        the
                        meat
                        starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time. </p>
                    <li>Add the ground beef, then the Worcestershire sauce and broth </li>
                    <p>Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Drain the
                        pan
                        of
                        excess
                        fat, if necessary (anything more than 1 tablespoon). Season with salt and pepper. </p>
                    <p>Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low.
                        Cook
                        uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.
                    </p>
                    <p>Taste the cooked filling and, if needed, add more salt, pepper, Worcestershire, or other
                        seasonings
                        of
                        your
                        choice. </p>

                    <li> Mash the cooked potatoes</li>
                    <p>When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place
                        them in
                        a
                        bowl with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, taste, and
                        adjust
                        seasonings with salt and pepper. </p>

                    <li>Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish </li>
                    <p>Spread the cooked filling in an even layer in a large baking dish (such as a 9 x 13-inch
                        casserole.
                    </p>
                    <p>Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed
                        potatoes
                        with
                        a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative
                        designs
                        in
                        the mashed potatoes. </p>

                    <li> Bake</li>
                    <p>Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil
                        for
                        the
                        last
                        few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown. </p>
                    <p>(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the
                        high
                        heat of
                        the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.) </p>
